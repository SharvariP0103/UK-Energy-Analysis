# UK-Energy-Analysis
This presentation analyzes the UK's fuel mix using historical data to understand trends, fuel distribution, and forecast future demand and generation. 

# Key Areas of Analysis:

•	Historical trends in net demand and generation.

•	Distribution of different fuel types in generation and their estimated contribution to demand.

•	Trends in import interconnector flows.

•	Forecasting of demand and generation for the next two years.

# Assumptions:

•	Data accuracy and completeness.

•	Continuity of observed historical trends and seasonal patterns.

•	Suitability of the time series models used for forecasting.

•	Potential influence of uncaptured external factors.

# Abbreviations/ Data Explanation:

•	DATE: The date of the measurement.

•	YEAR: The year of the measurement.

•	MONTH: The month of the measurement.

•	TIME: The time of the measurement (the data seems to be recorded at half-hour intervals).

•	NET_DEMAND: The total demand for electricity from the grid.

•	TOTAL_SYSTEM_DEMAND: The total demand on the system, which might include losses or other factors in addition to net demand.

•	GENERATION: The total amount of electricity generated within the UK.

•	GAS, COAL, NUCLEAR, BIOMASS, OTHER, HYDRO, SOLAR: These columns represent the amount of electricity generated from these specific fuel sources.

•	SCOT_WIND, ENG_WIND, WALES_NI_WIND: These columns show the wind power generation in different regions of the UK.

•	UK_WIND: The total wind power generation across the UK.

•	WIND_CAPACITY: The installed capacity for wind power generation.

•	IMPORTS: The total amount of electricity imported into the UK.

•	IFA_FLOW, IFA2_FLOW, BRITNED_FLOW, MOYLE_FLOW, EAST_WEST_FLOW, NEMO_FLOW, NSL_FLOW, ELECLINK_FLOW, NET_INTERC_FLOW: These represent the electricity flow through different interconnectors (cables connecting the UK grid to other countries).

•	STORAGE, PUMPED_STORAGE: The amount of electricity stored, including pumped hydro storage.

•	CARBON_INTENSITY: The amount of carbon dioxide emissions produced per unit of electricity generated.
